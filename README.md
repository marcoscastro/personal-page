# My personal website
My personal page made with Python language and Bottle (web-framework for Python). 

Python + Bottle = happiness ;-)

I used the cloud platform Heroku. This tutorial helped me for deploy on Heroku: https://github.com/chucknado/bottle_heroku_tutorial

You can use and do what you want! Doubts? mcastrosouza@live.com
